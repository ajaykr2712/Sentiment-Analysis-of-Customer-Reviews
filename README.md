📊 Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews
## Overview
This project aims to develop an ML-based NLP model to analyze customer sentiment from product reviews. The project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Flask for an API.
## Features
🔍 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Remove HTML tags, punctuation, convert text to lowercase, remove stopwords, and lemmatize words.
📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize sentiment distribution.
🛠️ Model Training: Train multiple machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
🎯 Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters for the best performance.$
💾 Model Saving: Save the trained model and vectorizer for future use.
🌐 Flask API: Deploy the model using a Flask web application to predict sentiment from new reviews.

## Requirements
Install the required packages by running: pip install -r requirements.txt
